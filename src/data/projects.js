        content: "As cities modernize by moving utility infrastructure underground into utilidor systems, a critical challenge arises. The invisibility of these systems erodes public awareness, trust, and connection to civic maintenance. Through generative research with New York City residents, we identified a strong desire for transparent, real-time communication about underground work and recognition of the workers involved. In response, we designed and developed CitySense, a civic transparency platform comprising a mobile app and physical street installations. CitySense provides real-time visibility into utility health, an interactive underground map, issue reporting, and worker profiles. We conducted a 10-day field study with 10 participants, combining quantitative usage logging with qualitative interviews. Findings show that while transparency is highly valued, unclear labels and detached social features hindered usability. Users sought personalized, location-aware alerts and better integration of community engagement tools. We contribute design implications for civic transparency platforms, emphasizing clarity, contextual integration of social features, and personalized information filtering to foster public trust and participation in smart city infrastructure",
